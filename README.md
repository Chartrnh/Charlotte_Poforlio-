# Hi everyone! Welcome to Charlotte's Github Profile 
On this page, I will showcase all of the projects I have taken over throughout the years, which includes projects that I was assigned to as a student and personal projects I chose myself. 

My life mantra is "information is power", therefore, when it comes to daily business tasks, my goal has always been to make the most effective data-driven decision that improves results and saves costs. 

I am experienced in machine learning, supervised and unsupervised algorithms and use data visualization techniques to present the results. I use R, SQL,  Python, and Excel for my projects.
