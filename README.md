## Side note
As for project's topic, I figure that it is consequential to choose ones that showcase each essential steps of the data analysis process, which are: 
- Ask 
- Prepare 
- Process
- Analyse
- Share 
- Act 

Out of the six phases, Analyze is the one part that demand both knowledge and practical skills to achieve due to its nature of unpredictability. It entails using tools to format, transform data , identify pattern, and draw conclusion. To choose the closest model, it cannot solely base on the fittingness on existing data, but also on the future data that is not yet collected. if a model is running too close with the existing data, we are running the risk of overfitting which just simply implies its vulnerability to extreme future variance. However, if a too simple of a model is chosen, we will sacrifice the purpose of low errors. That is also the concept of bias-variance trade off. 

As for now, to tackle the complexity of this matter, I will start off with a topic that is just about model selections for a basic dataset. The dataset will only have one variable and 3000 observations and the objective of this project is to find the most suitable prediction model for it.
Furthermore, I will roughly follow the format above and, of course, go back and forth between steps to ensure the integrity of information.
